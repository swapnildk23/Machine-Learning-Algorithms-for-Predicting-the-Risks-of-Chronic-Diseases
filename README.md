# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Predicting-the-Risks-of-Chronic-Diseases


This repositry contains my internship project done at Varcons Technologies Pvt Ltd.<br />
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms. 

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms are explored in code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
